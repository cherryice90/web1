    JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development.
    It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and
    interactive elements to websites. ... Like server-side scripting
    languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere
    within the HTML of a webpage.
